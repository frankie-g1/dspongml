# Pong Lab: ML Player


## Introduction
Create an AI agent for the single player Pong-like game here.

## Steps

1. Create your own training file 
Make sure to set  `train = True` around lab4.py line 94 to record your states.  
Play the game until you have a satisfying recording. 

2. Train: 
Creat a separate notebook/script:  
Look at your csv and decide:  
	Supervised/unsupervised?
	Classification / regression / clustering? 
	https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html

Create X/y matrices  
See 5.2/12a: X_iris/y_iris setup via pd.drop()  
Train and save your ML model  
See class examples or https://github.com/memoatwit/dsexample/blob/master/Insurance%20-%20Model%20Training%20Notebook.ipynb
	
	`from joblib import dump, load`  
	`dump(clf, 'mymodel.joblib') #save`  
	`clf2 = load('mymodel.joblib')  #load`  
3. Deploy
Go back to lab4.py, set `train = False` and complete around line 150 to predict the next moving direction for the paddle. 

## Example
Here are two different types fo models from two different training sets playing solo:
